**Objective:**
Use Python libraries such as Pandasfor data operations, Seabornand Matplotlibfor data visualization and EDA tasks,NLTKtoextract and analyze the information,Sklearnfor model building and performance visualization, to predict our different categories of people’s mindsets.
**Tasks performed:**
- Read the Data from the Given excel file.
- Change our dependent variable to categorical. (0 to “Neutral,”-1 to “Negative”, 1 to “Positive”).
- Do Missing value analysisand drop all null/missing values.
- Do text cleaning. (remove every symbol except alphanumeric, transform all words to lower case, and remove punctuationand stopwords ).
- Create a new column and find the length of each sentence (how many words they contain).
- Split data into dependent(X) and independent(y) dataframe.
- Do operationson text data.
- Train new model•Normalize the prediction as same as the originaldata(prediction might be in decimal, so whoever is nearest to 1 is predicted as yes and set other as 0).
- Measure performance metricsand accuracy•print Classification report
